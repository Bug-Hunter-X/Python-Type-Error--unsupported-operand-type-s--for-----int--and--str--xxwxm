This bug demonstrates a common error in Python: attempting to perform an arithmetic operation on incompatible data types.  The function `function` attempts to add an integer (5) and a string ('10'). Python will raise a `TypeError` because it cannot implicitly convert the string to an integer.  The solution demonstrates how to convert the string to an integer before performing the addition.
